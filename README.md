# Turbo repo experiments

Basic Turborepo

- git-cz
- lint-staged (basically used as `pretty-quick`)
- Prettier (with `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`)
- ESLint
- Next
- Tailwind (no tsup/rollup/x-bundler required)
- Husky
- Shared UI lib PoC

I'd prefer not to use it atm, Turborepo being too early for now imo.
